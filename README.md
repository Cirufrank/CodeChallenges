# Code Challenges

Every day I like to complete at least one code challenge. To me, code challenges are like playing chess, and force me to be strategic and efficinet in the way that I go about solving my problems. In additional to this, as a life-long learner I love to learn new ways to imporve and optimize the way I solve problems though code, and solving coding challenges helps be stay sharp, improve my speed, and learn new ways to optimze the functions I write.

## Methodology

**Tech used:** JavaScript

I like to use a whiteboard or google document to write the answers to my code challenges, free of any assistive tools. This pushes me to truly know how to solve the problems I'm presented with, as well as how to communicate my thought process and the way I go about solving problems in real-time. Each day I talk out my solution to others or myself as I complete the challenge, to emulate how I would go about communicating my idea within a team.

## Lessons Learned:

No matter how many coding challenges are completed, there will always be more technologies and methods to learn. I find this beautiful and am excited for this life-long journery of software engineering that I'm on. Additionally, it's not necessarily how much you know, but how efficient you are at being able to find a solution whenever you're presented with a problem you haven't faced before or that you don't know the answer to. Lastly, there's a wealth on information on the internet, and through your colleagues, so research is key, and one should never be afraid to ask questions when needed.
